          <p>My name is Chris Judkins. I earned a BS in Cybersecurity Engineering from
            Augusta University.</p>

          <p>As for my hobbies, I have a passion for photography. I also enjoy writing code and building an
            overly-complex home network. Whenever I have the chance, I like to travel and try new things. As of May
            2019, my most recent adventure
            saw me leaving the US for the first time to study abroad in the UK. I believe that the best way to
            understand the world is to experience as many cultures as I can. That is what I classify as the human
            experience.</p>

          <p>I recieved a Comptia Security+ certification in 2017 (Exp. 04/19/2020). I was involved with my high
            school's CyberPatriot team for 3 years, attended the Cyber Sciences Summer Academy at Augusta University
            twice (Once was when the school was named GRU), and have been to numerous tech conferences in the Augusta
            area.</p>
