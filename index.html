      <h5 class="mt-0">About Me</h5>
      <p>My name is Chris Judkins. I am currently studying Cybersecurity Engineering at Augusta University!</p>
      <p>As for my hobbies, I have a passion for photography. I also enjoy writing code and building an overly-complex home network.
        Whenever I have the chance, I like to travel and try new things. As of May 2019, my most recent adventure saw me leaving the US for the first time to study abroad in the UK.
        I believe that the best way to understand the world is to experience as many cultures as I can. That is what I classify as the human experience.</p>
      <p>I am currently Comptia Security+ certified (Exp. 04/19/2020). I was involved with my high school's CyberPatriot team for 3 years,
        attended the Cyber Sciences Summer Academy at Augusta University twice (Once was when the school was named GRU),
        and have been to numerous tech conferences in the Augusta area.</p>
